# 7. Next steps

## What would you add?

This section is intentionally left blank for you to define.

Think of what you can do to clean up the code, add new features, make the game more difficult.

Inside the `/Solution` folder there is a version of the game that I've made some changes to as an example. These are:

- Added an app icon
- When the app loads, the game does not immediately begin. The user has to tap "Play" 
- When the game ends, the "Play" button becomes "Play again"
- When the tram collides with a signal fault, a small fire appears between the tram and the signal fault
- When the tram collides with a signal fault, it is not removed from the scene until the next game is started
